                <br>
                <h2 class="sub-title">Introduction:</h2>
                <p>As an enthusiastic member of the FabLab community at SSGMCE, I delved into various modules to expand my skill set. The second module, focusing on Computer-Aided Design (CAD), provided me with an in-depth understanding of engineering graphics and the tools to create intricate 2D and 3D models using software like Fusion 360 and AutoCAD.</p><br>
                <h2 class="sub-title">Exploring CAD:</h2>
                <p>The CAD module was a captivating journey into the realm of design and engineering visualization. It commenced with an introduction to engineering graphics, teaching me the essential principles of technical drawing, orthographic projections, and dimensioning. These foundational concepts laid the groundwork for my ventures into digital design.</p><br>
                <h2 class="sub-title">Software Proficiency:</h2>
                <p>The heart of the CAD module was mastering industry-standard software applications: Fusion 360 and AutoCAD.
                </p><br>
                <h2 class="sub-title">Fusion 360:</h2>
                <p> Fusion 360 is a versatile software that seamlessly combines design, engineering, and manufacturing capabilities. It enables the creation of 2D sketches that can be extruded, revolved, and manipulated into 3D models. The parametric modeling approach in Fusion 360 empowers users to make changes to the design while maintaining associativity between components.</p><br>
                <h2 class="sub-title">AutoCAD:</h2>
                <p>AutoCAD is a pioneering software used for 2D and 3D computer-aided design and drafting. It excels in creating precise technical drawings, architectural plans, and mechanical designs. With features like layers, blocks, and dimensions, AutoCAD streamlines the design process and facilitates accurate communication of design intent.</p><br>
                <h2 class="sub-title">Creating 2D and 3D Models:</h2>
                <p>Equipped with newfound software skills, I embarked on the journey of creating 2D and 3D models. The process involved translating theoretical knowledge into practical applications. I began by sketching basic 2D shapes and progressed to designing more complex objects. This hands-on experience helped me comprehend the relationship between technical drawings and their digital counterparts.Here are some 3D models created by me on Fusion360:</p><br>
