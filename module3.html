                <h2 class="sub-title">My Laser Cutting Journey:</h2>
                <p>This report outlines the step-by-step journey I followed to laser cut a parametric design onto cardboard.
                <br><br><h2> Step 1: Design Creation in Fusion 360:</h2>
                The process commenced with creating a 2D design within Fusion 360. The design was meticulously crafted, ensuring that it was adaptable and parametric in nature. This step was crucial as the design's dimensions and details needed to be accurately represented in the final physical object.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Step 2: Conversion to DXF Format:</h2><br>
                Upon completing the design, I converted it into a .dxf file format. This format is compatible with Laser Cad, the software used in conjunction with the SIL Laser Engraving-Cutting machine. This conversion ensured that the design's intricacies would be accurately interpreted during the laser cutting process.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                  <h2>Step 3: Laser Cutter Configuration:</h2><br>
                 With the .dxf file ready, I proceeded to the SIL Laser Engraving-Cutting machine. Here, I selected the appropriate power and speed settings for the laser cutter, taking into consideration the material â€“ in this case, cardboard. These settings ensured that the laser cutter would execute precise cuts without compromising the material's integrity.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h2>Step 4: Modifying Dimensions and Position:</h2><br>
                 Before initiating the cutting process, I modified the dimensions and position of the design on the cardboard. The software associated with the laser cutter allowed me to align the design with precision, ensuring that it would be cut according to my specifications on the chosen cardboard piece.
                 <br>
                 <br>               
                 <h2>Step 5: Initiating the Cutting Process:</h2><br>
                 With all parameters set, I confidently pressed the start button, initiating the laser cutting process. The machine's precision and accuracy were evident as it meticulously followed the design's contours, creating a tangible representation of my digital creation on the cardboard.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h2>Step 6: Completion and Result:</h2><br>
                 After a period of time, the laser cutting process concluded, and I was left with the astonishing outcome of my first-ever laser cut design. The intricate details and precise cuts were a testament to the convergence of digital design and fabrication technology. The parametric design had been transformed from a digital concept into a physical artifact.
